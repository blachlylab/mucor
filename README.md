Introduction
============

Mucor is software to aggregate variant information sourced from multiple VCF files (and some others, see below) into a variety of summary files with varying levels of detail and statistics. The outputs range from high-level summaries to full, detailed reports in text and Microsoft Excel formats. The intended audience is both biologists and bioinformaticians.

Requirements
============

Python modules
--------------

The following modules are required:

* numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* HTSeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/)

The following modules are optional:

* pytabix (https://github.com/slowkow/pytabix)
* XlsxWriter (https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter)
* xlwt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt)

Additional tools
----------------

* bgzip and Tabix (optional, see _Databases_, below; https://github.com/samtools/htslib)

Annotation
----------

Mucor requires a reference annotation file (in GTF or GFF3 format) for feature definition. Contig (chromosome) names must match between the input VCF and reference annotation file; for example, for _Homo sapiens_, UCSC uses the form **chr17** while Ensembl uses the form **17**. 

Protip: If your human data are aligned and variants called with _chr_ style contig names but you wish to use Ensembl genes, you can try the GENCODE annotation which contains most Ensembl genes but using _chr_ style contig numbering.

Databases
---------

Mucor can _optionally_ check variants against any number of supplied databases and report presence (including identifier) or absence in the database. Common choices would be one or more releases of dbSNP (e.g., dbSNP 137 and latest dbSNP; dbSNP clinvar and dbSNP all), 1000 Genomes, NHLBI 6500 Exomes, or COSMIC. Users may also supply their own custom databases.

Databses must meet the following requirements:
* Conform to VCF standard format
* be compressed with bgzip (_not_ gzip; see below)
* be indexed with tabix (see below). 

bgzip and tabix provide massive speedups looking up variants in these external files. The database lookup feature is not available if files are not correctly bgzipped or tabix indexed, or if the Pytabix module is not installed. `bgzip` and `tabix` are available as part of `htslib` (https://github.com/samtools/htslib)

### Database preparation

Beginning with an example VCF `dbSNP.vcf`, execute the following:

```
$ bgzip dbSNP.vcf
$ tabix -p vcf dbSNP.vcf.gz
```

Note that bgzipped files can be treated as regular .gz files by other tools.


Variant call data
-----------------

These data are the data that you wish to aggregate and summarize. In theory, Mucor will work with any well-formed generic VCF, but it has been tested with and contains specific code to handle VCF files generated by the following tools:

* snpEff
* Ion Torrent PGM (default machine output)
* Illumina Miseq (default machine output)
* GATK
* GATK SomaticIndelDetector
* GATK HaplotypeCaller
* MuTect
* VarScan
* FreeBayes
* Samtools

In addition, VAS can read the more detailed .out files produced by MuTect.


Installation
============

git clone https://github.com/blachlylab/mucor.git

Setup and Operation
===================

Overview
--------
Running Mucor to aggregate and summarize variants is a two step process:

1. Project setup / configuration
    * `mucor_config.py` creates a JSON config file

2. Aggregation (MuCorrelate!)
    * `mucor.py` 

Project setup
-------------

### Configuration with `mucor_config.py`

The configuration step is completed using the provided `mucor_config.py` utility. It accepts the following command line arguments and creates a JSON file that will be passed to the main Mucor script. 

`-ex, --example`        Print a valid, example JSON config file and exit.
Function that will write a template of the JSON config. It can be edited manually and supplied to mucor. 

`-g GFF, --gff GFF`
Reference annotation GFF/GTF for feature binning. Required

`-f FEATURETYPE, --featuretype FEATURETYPE`
Feature type into which to bin. Gencode GTF example: gene_name, gene_id, transcript_name, transcript_id, etc. Required

`-db DATABASES, --databases DATABASES`
Colon delimited name and path to variant database in bgzipped VCF format. Can be declared >= 0 times. Ex: -db name1:/full/user/path/name1.vcf.gz. Optional

`-s SAMPLES, --samples SAMPLES`
Text file containing sample names. One sample per line. Configuration may not be correct if any sample names are within another sample name. Ex: U-23 and U-238. U-23 would erroneously identify U-238 files, requiring manual modification of the JSON file. Required

`-d PROJECT_DIRECTORY, --project_directory PROJECT_DIRECTORY`
Working/project directory, in which to find variant call files to aggregate. Variant calls can be in the provided directory, or any of its subdirectories. Default: current working directory

`-vcff VCF_FILTERS, --vcf_filters VCF_FILTERS`
Comma separated list of VCF filters to allow. Default: PASS

`-a ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY, --archive_directory ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY`
Specify directory in which to read/write archived annotations. This step will significantly speed up future runs that use the same annotation and feature type, even if the sample data changes. Undefined will prevent using the annotation archive features. Optional

`-r REGIONS, --regions REGIONS`
Comma separated list of bed regions and/or bed files by which to limit output. Bed regions can be specific positions, or entire chromosomes. Ex: chr1:10230-10240,chr2,my_regions.bed. Optional

`-jco JSON_CONFIG_OUTPUT, --json_config_output JSON_CONFIG_OUTPUT`
Name of JSON configuration output file. This is the configuration file fed into Mucor. Required

`-outd OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
Name of directory in which to write Mucor output. Required

`-outt OUTPUT_TYPE, --output_type OUTPUT_TYPE`
Comma separated list of desired output types. Options include: counts, txt, longtxt, xls, longxls, bed, featXsamp, featmutXsamp, all. Default: counts,txt
(See the detailed description of [Output File Formats](#output-file-formats), below)


### JSON config file

`mucor_config.py` produces a JSON-formatted configuration file embodying the selected options for the subsequent Mucor run. The configuration could be edited manually (e.g., to tweak a database name or path) or programmatically (e.g., if `mucor_config.py`'s guesses about sample IDs were incomplete) at this stage.

Alternatively, `mucor_config.py -ex` produces a syntactically valid example JSON file for editing.

Producing a configuration file is intended to facilitate the following:
* Consistency between runs
* Documentation of settings
* Easier use with dozens to thousands of input files
 

Aggregation (MuCorrelate!)
--------------------------

Execution: `mucor.py <config.json>`

Mucor is executed by launching the main `mucor.py` script, passing as a single parameter the name of the previously generated/edited JSON file. 

Output files of the specified type are placed in the output directory specified during configuration.


Output File Formats
-------------------
Output types are specified at the time of configuration. The user may select any number and combination of output types from the list below.  

**all**
Execute all output types

**counts**
Print counts of mutations per feature. Output: `counts.txt`

**txt**
Print all information about each variant, with one-per-row, irrespective of how many samples in which it appears. Useful for variant-centric projects. Identical to xls in layout. Output: `variant_details.txt`

**longtxt**
Similar to txt above, but writes each instance of a variant to a new row. Each variant is written once per source file, instead of combining recurrent variations into 1 unique row. Identical to longxls in layout. Output: `long_variant_details.txt`

**xls**
Print all information about each variant, with one-per-row, irrespective of how many samples in which it appears. Useful for variant-centric projects. Identical to txt in layout. Output: `variant_details.xls/xlsx`

**longxls**
Similar to xls above, but writes each instance of a variant to a new row. Each variant is written once per source file, instead of combining recurrent variations into 1 unique row. Identical to longtxt in layout. Output: `long_variant_details.xls/xlsx`

_NB_: The XLS format has a hard limit of 2^16 rows; in long record format, a moderate sized study could exceed this (2,000 total variants/sample * 32 samples = 65,536 rows). Mucor can use Python's `xlwt` module to write .xls format, but it is preferrable to have `XlsxWriter` or `openPyxl` installed for .xlsx support.

**bed**
Print bed file of the variant locations Output: `variant_locations.bed`

**vcf**
Print vcf file of the variant locations, features, depths, and variant frequencies. Output: `variant_locations.vcf`

**featXsamp**
Print table of mutation counts per feature per sample. Samples are in columns, while features are in rows. The count of unique mutations per sample per feature are the table values. This output is useful for examining patterns in variation across samples, for example, to look at combinatoric mutation status for selected recurrently mutated genes. This output could be used directly to make a heatmap. Output: `feature_by_sample.txt`

**featmutXsamp**
Print table of mutations per sample. Unlike **featXsamp**, this differentiates among different variants within the same features. For example, in acute leukemia, the functional effect of mutations in DNMT3A depends on whether it is an R882 mutation or non-R882 mutation. As before, samples are in columns, with features in rows. However, rows 2-4 contain information about chromosome, position, ref, and alt. The table values are boolean: 1 for present mutation, 0 for missing mutation. This output could be used directly or with appropriate filtering to make an Oncoprint. Output: `feature_and_mutation_by_sample.txt`


Known Issues
============
There is an issue when a variant file presents a contig that the pickled (archived) annotation does not have. The solution is to disable the archive feature by omitting the `-a` or `--archive_directory` option. This will permit the unknown contig in output, but all mutations on the unknown contig will be shown as having no feature. It may also be possible to make a new pickle file using an annotation GTF/GFF which does contain the contig in question.

    File "mucor/mucor.py", in parseVariantFiles
      resultSet = gas[ var.pos ]      # returns a set of zero to n IDs (e.g. gene symbols)
    File "_HTSeq.pyx", line 521, in HTSeq._HTSeq.GenomicArray.__getitem__ (src/_HTSeq.c:10700)
    KeyError: 

The VCF file needs to have columns #CHROM, POS … etc. The configuration script checks each VCF file for proper columns and will print a warning if any are missing or wrong. However, it does not halt execution and will include any malformed column VCF files and attempt to process them regardless. The main script may finish execution with the malformed VCF, but the output may be perturbed or useless.

    File "mucor/inputs.py", in parse_VarScan
        position = int(row[fieldId['POS']])
    KeyError: 'POS'

Users may not supply vcf files that have inconsistent 'effect' and/or 'functional consequence' for the same variant. Presumably, if the variant has the same location and reference and alternate allele, the effect and functional consequences would be predicted to be the same. The problem lies in collapsing mutations in the `variant_details` output type(s). This issue may arise when different platforms or pipelines are used for samples containing a common variant within a single run of VAS. If this is found to be more common than expected it will be worked around.
